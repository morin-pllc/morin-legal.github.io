Everyone has an estate, granted some are larger than others, but an estate plan lets you decide who receives your assets after youâ€™re gone.   However, a well-designed estate plan offers more than just deciding who gets what, such as providing for family members with special needs and deciding who raises your children should something happen to you.  A typical estate plan consists of a Will/Trust, Power of Attorney and Health Care Proxy.  Remember, without an estate plan in place, your assets will be distributed according to the intestacy laws of Massachusetts, a situation which is easily avoided.
