Probate is the legal process for transferring an individual's estate upon his or her death.  If probate is necessary, it may involve authenticating a decedent's Last Will and Testament (if they had one), locating and determining the value of the estate's assets, paying final bills and taxes and distributing the remainder of the estate to the rightful people and/or organizations.  If a friend or family member has passed away and you are designated as the estateâ€™s Executor or Personal Representative, be aware that understanding the probate process can be difficult.  There are complex codes and forms that will be involved, and mistakes can be costly.  Anyone in such a situation should consider speaking with an experienced attorney.
